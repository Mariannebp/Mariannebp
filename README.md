<h1 align=center>Well hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marianne!</h1>

I am 37 years old, originally coming from Ulefoss but are currently living in TÃ¸nsberg. Since october 2020 i have been studying Front End Developement at Noroff School of Technology and Social Media, and I am really having fun studying and learning about Front End. Yes, it can of course be a bit frustrating at times, but mostly fun :wink:
